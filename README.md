//PROJECT PROPOSAL

Project name: Hotel Register

Hotel register is the main project idea of this team since it would require the biggest amount of information used as objects in our solution. Register is imagined as application hotels could use to keep track of their customer's needs and services they provide.

Part of the program is for customers and it would be available on hotel's website so that customers can see what kind of rooms hotel provides, which one would be available in the period they need, as well as make reservations without any phone calls or sending e-mails. Customers would be available to enter prices they are willing to spend during their visit and get instant info for room and restaurant offers for their budget. Customers would be able to see what are the room specifications they can get (with or without TV, air conditioning, wi-fi etc..).

The other part of program is for hotel's staff, administration and managers. This part is mainly for registering customers, their personal information, payment transactions etc... These information can be a very powerful tool for hotel marketing. Using customers register can provide an insight to customers needs in order to improve hotel service. Keeping track of how many customers hotel has in one part of the year can be used to offer special prices and special services for that specific time (New Year, Christmas...).

The best part of this register is that it can be extended to as many services as hotel offers(restaurant, bar, fitness center, etc...).
